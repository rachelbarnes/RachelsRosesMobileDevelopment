	End goal: create mobile application for recipe management, still focusing on recipe measurement conversion, recipe and ingredient pricing and ingredient pantry. 
		I would like nutritional values as well and being able to adjust ingredients based on the nutritional value (vegetable oil replaced by apple sauce, etc.)

	For the View/Ingredient object, have the grams of the ingredient as well as the measurement in pt 10 font underneath the measurement 

	VS Unit Tests
	LINQ Queries
	More Try Catches
	More with attributes 

Stories: 
 - measurement conversion methods (cups => teaspoons, etc.)
 - density conversion methods (ounces => grams, ounces => fl oz (?), lbs => ounces, etc.)
 - when noting measurements for ingredients, include the grams used in a small text under ingredient in view
 - split a measurement; split a multi level meaurement
 - parse a decimal into a fraction
 - convert a measurement based on a multiplier (yield)
	- requires total teaspoons amount, then multiplying, then narrowing down cups, tablespoons and teaspoons 
 - make call to Walmart API for ingredient information
	- unless the name is exact, i don't get a response... there's no grace in the name
		- do a try catch here... try the response and in the catch give a list of ingredient names/itemresponse names from 
			a table in the database and have the user in the UI choose one of those, then use the information from tha name

 - make a table for the conversions of weights to ounces? 
	- can easily do this with my weight conversion with a Dictionary<string, decimal> for the weight as the string, and the amount of ounces for the weight as the decimal, adn then put the decimal in a weight conversion table

 - i want to make a table of all the selling prices for the ingredient name, weight, etc. of an ingredient, and then giving the average selling price
	- instead of adding the same price over and over again, have the number of times a seling weight is the same
		- columns:
			 - name: bread flour
			 - selling weight: 5 lb
			 - selling price: 4.69, 3.49
			 - count of ingredient instances in table: 4 (so there would be 4 times bread flour was inserted in this table...), 3
					this should eliminate the problem of having a massive amount of rows)
