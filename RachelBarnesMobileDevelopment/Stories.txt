	End goal: create mobile application for recipe management, still focusing on recipe measurement conversion, recipe and ingredient pricing and ingredient pantry. 
		I would like nutritional values as well and being able to adjust ingredients based on the nutritional value (vegetable oil replaced by apple sauce, etc.)

Stories: 
 - measurement conversion methods (cups => teaspoons, etc.)
 - density conversion methods (ounces => grams, ounces => fl oz (?), lbs => ounces, etc.)
 - when noting measurements for ingredients, include the grams used in a small text under ingredient in view
